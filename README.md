# JSMinesweeper
A project from the JS + ReactJS Intensive I'm currently taking from codeacademy.
Each version shows from beginning to end the evolution of the design + implementation of this program. Unless it is specified in the description of each version, the code will follow closely the algorithm given by the course which doesn't always implement the best programming practices (sometimes it is very repetitive). At some point I will do my own modifications in order to have a nice DRY and modifiable code.
